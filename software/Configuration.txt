Some tips to be checked:

- Invert Servo control
spindle_control.c
	//#define RC_SERVO_INVERT     1     // Uncomment to invert servo direction
		
- General
config.h
	// A simple software debouncing feature for hard limit switches. ... but it WILL NOT fix issues with electrical interference on the signal cables from external sources ....
	// #define ENABLE_SOFTWARE_DEBOUNCE // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.
	
	// If your machine has two limits switches wired in parallel to one axis, ... enable this feature. Since the two switches are sharing a single pin ...
	// #define LIMITS_TWO_SWITCHES_ON_AXES
	
	// Inverts pin logic of the control command pins. This essentially means when this option is enabled you can use normally-closed switches, rather than the default normally-open switches ....
	// #define INVERT_CONTROL_PIN // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.
